<p>While dividing an app into several targets can improve the build time of an iOS app, the result heavily depends on what is being changed. If you're not careful with how your dependency graph is laid out, you can often have results that are <b>worse</b> than non-modularized apps. Let's take a look at a technique used at iFood to have big and consistent improvements to the build times of our app.</p>
<h2>Context: The process to modularize an app</h2>
<p>Before jumping into the actual techniques, let's add some context to this so we have a better idea of <b>why</b> they are necessary.</p>
<p><i>(For the purposes of this article, we ignore the concept of Xcode's incremental build feature as I personally never saw it make a considerable difference in build times compared to the improvements you get by properly modularizing the app. This is geared towards apps that are built on top of monorepo systems that cache builds between CI builds)</i></p>
<p>When tasked to develop a small project, a developer's first idea will usually be to create a <b>single target</b> that contains absolutely all the code and resources:</p>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Td17sGi.png" alt="Big Target">                                
</div>
<p>This is how beginners usually develop their first few apps, and how seasoned developers still develop apps that are sufficiently small for this approach to be useful.</p>
<p>This approach is the easiest one in terms of project maintainability, but the worse one in terms of build times. Because everything is packed together, changing <b>anything</b> results in <b>everything</b> being recompiled, even if they have nothing to do with what's changed. While this not much of a problem for small apps, big ones take massive performance hits with this approach, easily reaching build times of over twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Because of that, more seasoned developers will often opt for a modularized structure when developing apps. This time, instead of having a single monster target, we divide our code and resources into several smaller ones, which are then linked together either manually inside Xcode, or through a dependency manager like CocoaPods / monorepo build system like Buck (what we personally use at iFood)</p>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/M69uv4R.png" alt="App with some targets">            
</div>
<p>In this specific diagram, because the targets have no connection to each other, making changes to a feature will make so that other features <b>do not</b> get recompiled, which provides a massive boost to the app's build time. Hooray!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this statement is only true to this specific diagram. As an app grows, it's more likely that you will end with something like this:</p>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7R1dewm.png" alt="Bad dependency cycle">           
</div>
<p>While the previous condition is still true if the changes are made to the targets in the lower end of this graph (<b>AppFeature1</b>, <b>AppFeature2</b>, <b>AppFeature3</b>), it is not true for the rest.</p>
<p>Take the <b>HTTPClient</b> target for example: Because <b>everyone</b> depends on it, making changes to it will make the <b>entire app need to be recompiled</b>, even if the changes have nothing to do with the targets themselves, like a simple code quality improvement!</p> 
<p>Another common problem of this approach is how <b>AppFeature1</b> is structured: It has a dependency on <b>AppFeature4</b>, which on its turn has a dependency on <b>AppFeature5</b>. An example of how this can happen is if these features represent <b>UIViewControllers</b> -- making so a target needs to import another one for a view to be able to be pushed. This <b>linear dependency</b> between these targets has three major problems:</p>
<p>- Because the dependency is linear, you are unable to compile them in parallel, which is a major performance problem.</p>
<p>- Changing <b>AppFeature5</b> will recompile <b>AppFeature4</b> and <b>AppFeature1</b> even if the changes have nothing to do with them, just because they depend on it!</p>
<p>- Finally, the fact that they completely depend on each other is overkill. They are dependencies only for the purpose of being able to navigate between each other -- they don't need access to anything else of the respective targets. This makes the previous problem even more critical as these features will be recompiled for no reason almost 100% of the time!</p>
<p>The problems of this diagram are a good representation of how iFood looked like for a long time, and although the modularization itself improved build times in some cases, most of the cases still provided very bad build times.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the best possible build times, we need to make our dependency graph as <b>horizontal</b> as possible. If everything is independent, everything can be compiled in parallel.</p>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gnne0rL.png" alt="Horizontal dependency">          
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, this is impossible in our case. Because our targets need to navigate between each other's <b>UIViewControllers</b>, they need to be able to reference each other somehow. The same applies to components like <b>HTTPClient</b> -- as they need to somehow have access to it in order to make HTTP requests, they can never be truly independent. ...or can they?</p>
<p>The true answer is, well, no. However, through dependency injection, there's a technique we can apply to get pretty close to it.</p>

<h2>"Interface" Targets: Never depend on concrete targets</h2>

<p>Let's focus on the problems caused by the previously mentioned <b>linear dependency</b> of some of the targets: These features depend on the targets of the features they navigate to, but they don't access anything of these targets besides the <b>UIViewController</b> that they are navigating to.</p> 
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAQ4CtN.png" alt="Problem">          
</div>
<p>If this problem is caused because the features are depending on more than they need to, what if we divide the navigation aspect of a feature from its actual contents? Having this in mind, instead of a having a massive "feature" target that has everything, we can separate the relevant navigation content into its own "interface" target:</p>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/u0sF8SF.png" alt="App with interfaces" style="height: 250px; width: 300px;">          
</div>
<p>"Interface" targets don't contain any concrete code or dependencies -- they just contain protocols that are used by the targets that depend on it to reference some piece of code that is defined in the real, concrete target.</p>
<p>For example, assuming that <b>AppFeature1</b> wants to push a <b>UIViewController</b> that lives in <b>AppFeature2</b>, instead of having <b>AppFeature1</b> depend on <b>AppFeature2</b> and directly reference such <b>UIViewController</b>, we can have it depend on a hypothetical <b>AppFeature2Interface</b> module that has a protocol that serves no purpose but to expose the existence of that view to <b>AppFeature1</b>:</p>

<pre>
<code>protocol Feature2ViewProtocol {}</code>
</pre>

<p><b>AppFeature2</b> can then implement this protocol into the related, concrete <b>UIViewController</b>:</p>

<pre>
<code>import AppFeature2Interface</code>
<code>class Feature2ViewController: UIViewController, Feature2ViewProtocol</code>
</pre>

<p>With this setup, <b>AppFeature1</b> can now reference <b>AppFeature2's</b> <b>UIViewController</b> without actually importing it:</p>

<pre>
<code>import AppFeature2Interface</code>
<code>let viewTypeToBePushed = Feature2ViewProtocol.self</code>
</pre>

<p>While <b>AppFeature1</b> still imports the interface itself, its size is considerably smaller than the actual feature's target, while the final result (getting a view to be pushed) is the same. <b>AppFeature1</b> now imports only what it really needs, making so it will only be recompiled by changes that actually affect it.</b>

<p>However, there's a small catch. You might notice that this example doesn't make sense: While <b>AppFeature1</b> has access to the protocol that references <b>AppFeature2's</b> <b>UIViewController</b>, it can't actually push it. If we only have access to the bare <b>protocol</b>, we are unable to create an instance of the concrete <b>class</b> that only exists in <b>AppFeature2</b>.</p>

<p>This is because we're missing a key component in this structure: <b>a dependency injector.</b> In an app like this, because there's no way for targets to reference the concrete information from other targets, there needs to be a global system that is capable of returning the (now hidden) concrete information to targets when a certain protocol is given. At iFood, we solved this by creating a dependency injector called <b>RouterService</b> -- here, each feature's target's interface only exposes a series of <b>Route</b> structs, while each feature's concrete target connects these <b>Routes</b> to the related <b>UIViewController</b>.</p>

<p>With this information exposed, iFood's AppDelegate creates an instance of a <b>RouterService</b> which receives every feature's routes and related <b>UIViewControllers</b>. When a feature asks for a specific <b>Route</b> from another feature's interface to be executed, the <b>RouterService</b> automatically locates which <b>UIViewController</b> should be pushed. The process to create something like was detailed in my previous article, <a href="https://swiftrocks.com/using-type-erasure-to-build-a-dependency-injector-in-swift">Using Type Erasure to Build a Dependency Injecting Routing Framework in Swift.</a> Here's a simplified example of how the previous example looks like in our app:</p>

<pre>
<code>// AppFeature2Interface, which depends on RouterServiceInterface</code>
<code>public struct Feature2Route: Route { ... }</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>// AppFeature2</code>
<code>import AppFeature2Interface</code>
<code></code>
<code>class Feature2ViewController: Feature { ... }</code>
<code></code>
<code>public class Feature2RouteHandler: RouteHandler { </code>
<code>    var routes: [Route.Type] {</code>
<code>        return [Feature2Route.self]</code>
<code>    }</code>
<code></code>
<code>    func featureFor(route: Route) -> AnyFeature {</code>
<code>        return AnyFeature(Feature2ViewController.self)</code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>// iFood's AppDelegate</code>
<code>import AppFeature1</code>
<code>import AppFeature2</code>
<code></code>
<code>let routerService = RouterService()</code>
<code>routerService.register(Feature1RouteHandler())</code>
<code>routerService.register(Feature2RouteHandler())</code>
<code>routerService.start(fromRoute: Feature1Route.self)</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>// AppFeature1</code>
<code>import AppFeature2Interface</code>
<code></code>
<code>func goToFeature2() {</code>
<code>    routerService.navigate(toRoute: Feature2Route())</code>
<code>    // RouterService translates Feature2Route into the actual Feature2ViewController</code>
<code>    // and pushes the related UIViewController.</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>

<p>In terms of build time, because <b>AppFeature1</b> doesn't depend on <b>AppFeature2</b> anymore, changes to <b>AppFeature2</b> will <b>not</b> recompile <b>AppFeature1</b>. If you had multiple targets depending on each other, an app that runs entirely on this structure will provide a massive boost in build performance!</p>

<p>As a bonus, this structure can be applied to everything that can be injected. Using the previous complete diagram as an example, we could also add an interface to the <b>HTTPClient</b> that contains only the protocol that defines how requests are made. This allows targets to only reference this protocol, while the dependency injector becomes responsible for injecting the actual concrete class into the targets that reference such protocol. In the end, we can end up with the following diagram:</p>

<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40" style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6sn22b4.png" alt="Full app with interfaces">            
</div>
<p><i>(Not shown: In our case, everyone depends on something called a <b>RouterServiceInterface</b>, with the main target depending on the concrete <b>RouterService</b>, which dynamically links the interfaces to their actual classes.)</i></p>
<p>Note how the graph is considerably more <b>horizontal</b> than its counterpart -- even though everyone depends on <b>HTTPClientInterface</b>, changes to the actual <b>HTTPClient</b> will have no repercussions on the other targets, making the app compile considerably faster. With an entire app running on this structure, you should only have bad compilation times if the interfaces themselves are changed -- something that should be a rare occurrence. In general, every target is going to be completely independent of each other, which can be especially useful and productive when developing inside the target's specific scheme in Xcode.</p>
