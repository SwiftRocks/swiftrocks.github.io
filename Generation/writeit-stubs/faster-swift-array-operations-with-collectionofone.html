<p><b>CollectionOfOne</b> is a type inside the Swift Standard Library that defines a <b>collection of a single element.</b> While this sounds a bit weird, there's a good reason for this to exist. Let's check out why.</p>
<h2>Operating on single elements</h2>
<p>Personally, I am guilty of creating single-element arrays to make simple operations like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>someArray += [someElement]</code>
</pre>
<p>I used to do things like this for readability reasons (as you may or may not agree that this looks better than an <b>append()</b> call in some cases), but it turns out <b>this is bad</b> for multiple reasons. Here's what happens internally when you do something like this:</p>
<p>* The compiler translates the array literal into <b>Array's</b> <b>ExpressibleByArrayLiteral</b> initializer.</p>
<p>* The array initializer will create a buffer to hold the single element.</p>
<p>* The single element is copied into that buffer.</p>
<p>* += is a wrapper for <b>appendContents(of:)</b>, which first increases the buffer's capacity based on the number of elements being added.</p>
<p>* Finally, the elements are copied from their original buffer to the one of the array they're being added to.</p>
<p>That's an enormous amount of stuff for something as simple as dealing with a single element! We're creating the entire stack for an array structure just for a simple <b>append()</b> when all we needed to do was get a hold of the single element and copy it into the original buffer.</p>
<p>Usually, this sort of innocent mistake is optimized by the compiler, but in this case, even with higher optimization levels, the <b>compiler does not appear to know how to optimize the array allocation part out of single-element operations.</b> If we extract the SIL out of that line of code, we'll get multiple references for array allocations:</p>
<pre>
<code>// function_ref _allocateUninitializedArray&lt;A>(_:)</code>
</pre>
<h2>CollectionOfOne - Collections, but not really</h2>
<p>To treat cases like this where the operation relies on a collection but you're only dealing with one element, the <b>CollectionOfOne</b> type can be used to efficiently represent these elements without having to worry about anything else that would normally come from the <b>Collection</b> protocol.</p>
<p>The way this works is straight-forward: the <b>CollectionOfOne</b> type implements <b>Collection</b>, meaning that it's able to respond to iterations and more. But instead of implementing these things with buffers like in an <b>Array</b>, the <b>CollectionOfOne</b> type simply holds a reference to the element:</p>
<pre>
<code>@frozen // trivial-implementation</code>
<code>public struct CollectionOfOne&lt;Element> {</code>
<code>  @usableFromInline // trivial-implementation</code>
<code>  internal var _element: Element</code>
<code></code>
<code>  /// Creates an instance containing just the given element.</code>
<code>  ///</code>
<code>  /// - Parameter element: The element to store in the collection.</code>
<code>  @inlinable // trivial-implementation</code>
<code>  public init(_ element: Element) {</code>
<code>    self._element = element</code>
<code>  }</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>
<p>Because it doesn't need to rely on buffers and all of that, it can directly return the element when being iterated:</p>
<pre>
<code>public mutating func next() -> Element? {</code>
<code>  let result = _elements</code>
<code>  _elements = nil</code>
<code>  return result</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>
<p>And because we're dealing with a single element, we don't need to worry about moving indexes or keeping track of element counts:</p>
<pre>
<code>public var startIndex: Index {</code>
<code>  return 0</code>
<code>}</code>
<code></code>
<code>public var endIndex: Index {</code>
<code>  return 1</code>
<code>}</code>
<code></code>
<code>public func index(after i: Index) -> Index {</code>
<code>  _precondition(i == startIndex)</code>
<code>  return 1</code>
<code>}</code>
<code></code>
<code>public func index(before i: Index) -> Index {</code>
<code>  _precondition(i == endIndex)</code>
<code>  return 0</code>
<code>}</code>
<code></code>
<code>public var count: Int {</code>
<code>  return 1</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>
<p>This makes <b>CollectionOfOne</b> a very efficient way to represent a single element. If we modify the original example to use <b>CollectionOfOne</b>, we can give our app a small performance boost.</p>
<pre>
<code>// Adding 10 million elements</code>
<code>someArray += [someElement]                // 8 seconds</code>
<code>someArray += CollectionOfOne(someElement) // 6.9 seconds</code>
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> Adding to an array was used as the example because I believe it's the most common way of reaching this problem, but this is actually a bad use case of <b>CollectionOfOne</b>. In this case, the best performance you can get is by using <b>append()</b> directly as that'll ensure the element is directly copied into the array's buffer without any overhead.</p>
<pre>
<code>someArray.append(someElement) // 4.9 seconds</code>
</pre>
<p>The cases where using <b>CollectionOfOne</b> is the best approach possible is when you are forced to operate on <b>Collections</b>. In the Standard Library for example, <b>CollectionOfOne</b> is used to insert elements in specific positions of an <b>Array</b>:</p>
<pre>
<code>public mutating func insert(_ newElement: __owned Element, at i: Int) {</code>
<code>  _checkIndex(i)</code>
<code>  self.replaceSubrange(i..&lt;i, with: CollectionOfOne(newElement))</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>
<p>Because <b>replaceSubrange</b> replaces a <b>Collection</b> with another one, cases where the replacement is only a single element can greatly benefit from using <b>CollectionOfOne</b>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When the performance gain isn't very high, I believe you should always value readability and maintainability over the gain. However, its always a good idea to understand the possible options and their trade-offs. Even if you never use <b>CollectionOfOne</b> directly, knowing of its existence and why it exists may help you make better decisions in the future.</p>
