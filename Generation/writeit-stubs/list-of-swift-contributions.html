          <p><i>It's not much, but it's mine!</i></p>
          <p>I keep this list as a personal motivator - Having merged commits in Swift used to be a dream of mine that I always shrugged off with the "I'm not good enough" excuse.</p>
          <p>I eventually realized how this imposter syndrome was bad for me and managed to achieve my dream. Although you won't learn anything crazy here, I hope that it can give you the motivation to do something cool!</p>
          <p>Given my articles, one would probably expect me to contribute mostly to the Swift Standard Library, but most of my contributions are actually to the C++ compiler - that's because the IDE section of the compiler is the cradle of my biggest open source project: <a href="https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield">SwiftShield</a>.</p>
