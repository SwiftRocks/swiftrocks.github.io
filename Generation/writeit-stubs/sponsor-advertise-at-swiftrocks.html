  <h1>Sponsorship and Advertising</h1> 
</div>
<p>SwiftRocks is a hub for advanced content. Each month, over 20,000 developers from around the world visit SwiftRocks to familiarize themselves with the most intricate details of iOS and Swift development.</p>
<p>If you're interested in advertising a product or service to an audience of expert Apple-platform developers, send an email to <code>bruno@swiftrocks.com</code> and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can with the latest availability details.</p>
<h2>Why advertise on SwiftRocks?</h2>
<p>While most blogs tend to be focused on beginner content and tutorials, SwiftRocks fills a niche of advanced content for already experienced developers. Readers of SwiftRocks are for the most part <b>power-users</b> with many years of experience and <b>junior developers with high ambitions</b>, and by sponsoring it you'll be exposing your product to the niche that will use it at the highest scale, level and expectations.</p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Each week of advertisement costs $100, and includes the placement of ads in every single article of the blog for the booked period and a personal shoutout on my Twitter. Additionally, if you book over a month, I'll give you a discount proportional to the number of weeks!</p>
