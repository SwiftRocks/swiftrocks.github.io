<p>I've been meaning to write an article about computer science fundamentals and how it can improve a programmer's career for a long time, but I never found a good way of introducing this topic. The reason I'd like to talk about this is first because, well, I really like this field and I feel that most of my programming ability today is a result of having studied this, but also because this topic has been a constant source of frustration for me.</p>
<p>The reason it's so is because I feel that the tech community, especially mobile developers, have strong misconceptions around this topic, especially when it shows up in interview processes. To be specific, there's a group of people who are really against the fact that large companies like Google and Apple base their interview processes around a person's knowledge of programming theory, to the point where they actively fight against this practice. This has evolved in a way where mentioning theory at all in certain places is met with severe backlash, quite literally implying that the field is useless and it's best to stay away from it.</p>
<p>This frustrates me a lot, because as someone who enjoys studying theory, I can see that there's a huge misunderstanding on what's the purpose on this field and *why* these companies chose to focus on it. Everyone is free to study and specialize in what they want, but I think we as a community should be careful when we advocate, especially in Twitter for thousands of followers, that others should be against something. As someone who sees the value of this field, these misunderstandings deeply hurt me as I believe that they can damage the careers of those who blindly believe on them, limiting what we as a community can achieve.</p>
<p>In this article, I would like to take a shot at resolving this misunderstanding. We'll take a neutral stance and introduce the field of algorithms and data structures, show how this knowledge is used in practice using an analogy, and finally explain why large companies like Google and Apple are so focused on it. I hope that this will give you the tools to make your own conclusions about this topic, allowing you understand why they do it and to determine if this is something you should study on not.</p>
<h2>What's the confusion about?</h2>
<p>The most common source of discussions and the main source of what I call misconceptions is how the interview process of large tech companies like Google, Apple and Facebook work. Regular companies usually hire programmers for a specific role at a specific platform (for example, iOS Developer), and thus their interview process tend focus on the practical aspects of these platforms, such as understanding how a particular platform works, the details of certain APIs, and the person's overall ability to work with that specific platform.</p>
<p>The larger companies however focus more on the theory of programming, asking questions not about what you can do in a specific platform, but about your understanding of the building blocks that allow such platforms to exist in the first place, like the functionality of basic data structures like Arrays and Sets, your ability to predict, often in an academic fashion, the performance of your code, and your knowledge of fundamental algorithms like a binary search, often in the shape of a programming puzzle. This field of knowledge is called "Algorithms and Data Structures", or CS Fundamentals for short. We'll later go into details on why they do this, but for now we'll focus on the field itself. //to-improve</p>
<p>When you study computer science at a more traditional college, these fundamentals are often introduced as the very introduction to programming itself. In these colleges, while you learn how to code, you will also be studying the fundamentals to understand how computer science in general works. Instead of programming for a specific platform, you'll often study programming from a generic point of view that you can apply to any field you want in the future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nowadays it's also very common for people to be self-taught or learn programming through bootcamps and online courses. In these cases, as far as I know, pretty much 100% of people who learn programming outside of traditional college skip this theory and go straight to coding on a specific platform, especially if they want to code for web or mobile. As we've seen above, because regular companies tend to focus more on the practical aspects of the programming, this is a perfectly fine practice, and one that I have done it too.</p>
<p>The confusion happens when a person with this background decides that it's time to apply at one of the world's main tech companies, and notice that there's a huge difference what the interview process cover topics and what they have experienced in practice as a programmer. People often get surprised by this, and some even publicly express their discontent with it, claiming that what these companies are doing is wrong. Among the people who are against the practice, common complaint points are:</p>
<p>- The questions doesn't reflect what the person will do in their job</p>
<p>- The questions are not indicative of the person's skill in the role being interviewed for (the job is often for a specific platform, but the questions are unrelated to it)</p>
<p>- The questions, in general, are useless. Why does an iOS developer needs to know how sorting functions work?</p>
<p>People who feel this way then claim that this field is something that only academics should worry about, and a practical programmer should not have to worry about this in a job interview.</p>
<p>Before we continue, an important distinction must be made: The purpose of this article is not to defend these companies' practices of applying difficult whiteboard puzzles in their interviews, but to clarify why they ask these questions. Whether or not these companies are testing this knowledge correctly, especially when it comes to fairness and inclusion, is a separate issue that will not be covered here. The focus is solely on the engineering aspect of these interviews to clarify where exactly the misunderstanding is.</p>
<p>Even though I have a biased opinion, I think anyone can see understand why someone would have these opinions. If you have never studied this field, it can definitely look like pieces of obscure knowledge that aren't relevant to most roles. They are called fundamentals, but someone can definitely learn how to code without them. Are they really that fundamental? Why do these companies care about them in that case?</p>
<p>The source of the misunderstanding comes from the third complaint: "nobody uses algorithms in real life". There's a belief these companies are insinuating that you as a programmer need to know these things because you should be explicitly coding them, but that's just not how any of this works. Absolutely nobody codes binary trees in their apps -- they use what they know about binary trees to draw conclusions about how their new custom object should work. Sounds familiar? That's how most of programming works, and you likely do it all the time with different reference points.</p>
<p>This implicitness gives people the impression that the fundamentals are useless, while in reality they're using them all the time! They just probably never made the distinction between what part of their knowledge is platform-specific (like knowing UIKit APIs in iOS) and what is actually fundamental knowledge (like knowing the difference between an Array and a Set) that they picked up in practice. In short, even if you never studied CS Fundamentals, you as a professional programmer probably already know part of it, you just skipped the part where you learn how to describe them in a more generic fashion.</p>
<p>What about the other part though? Even though everyone can learn about things like Arrays in practice, the fundamentals often go much deeper than that. When would knowing the ultra complicated details of something like a index tree ever be useful for a mobile developer?</p>
<h2>Analogy: Becoming a professional musician</h2>
<p>To clarify this, I would like to draw an analogy with a person's journey of learning a musical instrument. This is because musical instruments are accompanied by music theory, and the relation between them is pretty much exactly the same as the one between programming and algorithms.</p>
<p>In music, music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. It seeks to define the processes and general principles of music, but also the concepts that define what "music" itself is, like what exactly is a note, the theoretical definition of a chord and how it can be manipulated, how chords can be grouped into keys and how musical progression works.</p>
<p>A person who wants to learn an instrument such as an electric guitar and is doing music lessons will be introduced to the concept of music theory, but also be told that they don't really need to learn it to learn how to play the guitar. Although they will need to learn the basics of notes and chords, there's no need to get into the deeper complicated details unless the person happens to be interested in that. The learner will be perfectly capable to learn how to play their favorite songs, and even play in a cover band with their friends if they want to. As we've seen, this is exactly the role the fundamentals play in programming.</p>
<p>The details of music theory become important when the person starts wanting to compose their own songs. Although it's not impossible to do, if the person doesn't know the theory, it's likely that these songs are going to be hilariously bad. Because this person doesn't know music/chord theory, they will probably have a really hard time figuring out the correct way of achieving sounds that they have never played before, or even determining which sounds they should use at all. That person is perfectly capable of playing the chords and songs composed by other people, but if they never studied the theory of all of that, they will be extremely hindered when trying to compose their own songs. To make it worse, musical progression is not a thing you just come up with -- songs aren't random, the chords for each song have a theoretical relation to each other. Making a decent song is a science, and one can learn it by understanding the theory. We can say that is the more explicit application of music theory, which could be comparable to a programmer actually being tasked to code these algorithms.</p>
<p>However, music theory has also an implicit benefit, which is that people who learn music theory become better musicians in general. Even though the person might not be composing their own songs, their understanding of how music works likely makes them extremely comfortable playing and improvising any kind of song. These people are usually extremely skilled, being able to learn how to play new songs by simply hearing them, without ever needing to check how the band that made the song actually plays it. The logic is simple: they don't need to, because they understand music.</p>
<p>Another implicit benefit of music theory is that it applies to every instrument. People who understand music theory usually have a very easy time mastering different instruments, because most of what they know also applies to this new instrument. The difference is simply how the instrument is played.</p>
<p>This is exactly the benefit that learning CS Fundamentals provide you in every day programming. Even through you're not "composing your own algorithms", your knowledge of how computer science works provides a serious boost to your programming ability in general.</p>
<p>The difference between music and programming lies in where this benefit is useful. While a musician who doesn't know theory will be bad at composing songs, a programmer who doesn't know theory won't necessarely create bad products. What's "bad" in this scenario is not the product itself, but the quality of the code from an engineering perspective. Just like in the music analogy, a programmer that doesn't know theory is perfectly capable of creating software that uses frameworks created by other programmers, but they will likely have a hard time creating optimized components of their own. If the person doesn't understand how the basic data structures work or the basics of algorithm analysis, even though the framework might achieve its objective it's very likely that what they've written will be inefficient from a performance and resources point of view. // fix me</p>
<h2>Career-wise, who needs to learn music theory?</h2>
<p>I hope that this analogy has clarified to you why CS Fundamentals are useful. In this section, we'll try to evaluate this knowledge from a career necessity stand point, and use this to finally discuss why companies like Google are so obsessed with it. //fix me</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, the necessity of studying music theory in a musician's career heavily depends on what the musician wishes to achieve:</p>
<p>- Do I want to learn it as a hobby, and never go beyond playing in my couch for fun?</p>
<p>- Do I want to actually play in band, but in a sort of fun way, without taking music that seriously in my life?</p>
<p>- Do I aspire to make music my life, become the lead guitarrist of Iron Maiden, tour the world, and go down as a legend that literally shaped the very concept of music itself?</p>
<p>It should be clear that our non-Maiden-dreamer-fanatics don't need music theory, as they can definitely achieve everything they want without it. They can still massively benefit from it -- learning it would allow them to master their instrument, as well as opening the door to every other musical instrument. However, from a purely career necessity stand point, the theory is just a bonus thing they can learn to be a better musician.</p>
<p>The dreamer, however, has a completely different objective. This person is not looking to simply have fun with friends, they want to be part of a group of people that are so good that they can literally influence how the world perceives music. Iron Maiden will obviously not accept some random dude who picked up a guitar weeks ago -- you must understand what you're doing, and for this it should be clear that mastering the concept of music itself is a bare minimum.</p>
<p>Just like in this analogy, the necessity of the CS Fundamentals in your career depends on what you as a programmer wants to achieve it. If you learnt programming as a hobby and don't really want to work with it, then the fundamentals are not necessary at all. Similarly, if you see yourself working at a regular, more practical non-tech company that just happens to need software in a very specific platform, then it's also likely that you will never face a situation where the fundamentals might make a big difference. You could learn it to improve your ability in general, but from a pure necessity stand-point you can surely live without it.</p>
<p>However, if you aspire to learn multiple platforms, work in a global tech company with amazing salaries and perks, working with incredibly smart people who are at the top of their field helping them literally define what tech is, then it should be trivial that you as a programmer must master computer science. With this notion, we're now ready to understand the interview process of these companies.</p>
<h2>Why FAANG companies focuses so much on fundamentals?</h2>
<p>To understand why larger companies are so obsessed with the theory, we'll focus on one of the other complaints: "The questions doesn't reflect what the person will do in their job".</p>
<p>What's interesting about this complaint is... that it's actually right. Didn't expected me to say that at this point, right?</p>
<p>This notion is absolutely true, because you're never gonna be handling generic algorithm puzzles in your job. The misunderstanding here is in a different place -- the problem is not in what they are asking, but what the people expect that their role will be in these companies, and I think the job descriptions are the problem in this case.</p>
<p>While in smaller companies you are likely to be hired to perform a very specific role as a specialist, larger companies like Google are almost always focused on engineering T-shapedness and generalism. This means that even though you might be hired as, say, an iOS developer, there's an expectation that you have the ability to seamleslly work with multiple platforms. This is something that even me at Spotify, a company that does not do generic whiteboard puzzles (at least for iOS), deals with sometimes -- even though I work primarely with iOS, it's not uncommon for me to have to deal with some C++ or Backend code.</p>
<p>I'd say that the reason why this happens is the nature of these companies -- while a smaller company is trying to solve a small scale problem that has likely been done before, top-tier companies have to deal with enourmous problems that nobody has ever faced, which often requires them to be masters in multiple platforms. It's not interesting for a company like Google to hire someone who dedicated their life to understand all about UIKit in iOS -- their problem is not that they don't know which UIKit APIs to use, is that the APIs they need don't exist at all. These problems are not solvable by platform experts, but by people who understand computer science theory and can craft new and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>Just like how music theory apply to all instruments, the fundamentals apply to all platforms. A reason why these companies focus on them is because it essentially proves that you can work with anything -- even if you never worked with a different platform, knowing CS Fundamentals will likely make it very easy for you to pick them up. A generalist might not know some random trivia about UITableView APIs that a specialist would, but they don't need to -- they can learn this song just by hearing it. It's easy for a generalist to learn programming languages and platforms -- what's difficult to learn are programming skills you need to have to use these languages and platforms.</p>
<p>This is why these companies focus on them -- while in smaller companies you can prove your ability by answering questions about a specific platform, in a world of generalists where this platform specific knowledge is considered trivial it's your understanding of programming in general that proves you're the type of engineer they need.</p>
<p>I think this is ultimately the reasoning that people who are frustrated with this interview format fails to see: The role you want to have might not be what a specific company is looking for. It's perfectly fine to not want to get yourself super deep into engineering and focus your career on a specific platform, but if you do so, I think you should manage your expectations on what kinds of places you'll be able to work for. Surely pretty much everyone would like to work at a global tech company with amazing salaries, benefits, free food, off-sites and all of that, but are you sure you're actually what they are looking for? They might need a skill set that you don't have. Are you willing to obtain this knowledge?</p>
