Ever since SiriKit first came out I was very disappointed that you couldn't use it for your own custom commands, but the new Shortcuts app solves this problem. Not only it allows you to create your custom commands, but it also provides a very intuitive UI to allow even non-devs to automate tons of kinds of workflows in their iPhones."

  <p>Hi! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/rockbruno_">Bruno Rocha</a>, and I'm a software engineer at <b>Spotify</b>, advisor at <a href="https://unspun.io/">Unspun</a>, and developer of <a href="https://burnoutbuddy.rockbruno.com">BurnoutBuddy</a>. I mostly write articles about advanced iOS / Swift topics, but I also occasionally write about general software engineering and my opinions on the industry.</p>
  <p>Right now I don't have a fixed process for consultancy work, but if you'd like my assistance with your project and/or startup, feel free to send me an e-mail and we'll work from there. I'm a fan of startups and entrepeneurship, so if you're looking for a tech advisor, I'd love to help!</p>
