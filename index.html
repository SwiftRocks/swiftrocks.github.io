The internal algorithm used to calculate a type's `hashValue` (now `Hasher` in Swift 4.2) and the related compiler features changed several times throughout Swift's releases, ant it was only after Swift 4.2 that a real universal hashing algorithm was added to Swift. To see how this is implemented today, let's take a look at how this looked like throughout the history of Swift."

Using an automatic dependency injector as an example, let's see how generic arguments and closures can be 'erased' to trick the compiler into compiling code that it would otherwise claim to be impossible (when it's clearly not!). While this isn't your usual SwiftRocks-compiler-feature-deconstruction article, we'll take an exciting look at how the treatment of methods/closures as properties can be used in this context to bypass one of the Swift Compiler's most annoying compilation errors."

Let's see what this protocol is, why OptionSets are preferred over a regular Set in some cases and finally what compiler magics it possesses."

This time, we'll take a look at what NSCopying and its companion class NSZone are and what they can do for Swift apps."

<p>Even if you don't know what the <b>Observer</b> pattern is, there's a good chance that you applied it somewhere in the past. This design pattern is used to create APIs that notify one or more subjects about changes in a certain object, with the <code>NotificationCenter</code> being the most popular use of this pattern in iOS.</p> 
<p>In this article, I'll show you a memory management trick with some old-school <code>Foundation</code> types that can be used in any object that applies the <b>Observer</b> pattern to create better and safer APIs.</p>

<p>When jailbreaking of iOS devices first became popular, it was very common for iOS developers to try to defend their apps from users that altered their devices to enable piracy. As (possibly) a response to jailbreaking become popular again in recent times, Apple has released their own solution to this problem. In iOS 14, the new <b>App Attest</b> APIs provide you a secure way to sign server requests to prove to your server that they came from an <b>uncompromised</b> version of your app.</p>
<p>It's important to know that <b>App Attest is not a "is this device jailbroken?" check</b>, as that has been proven over and over to be impossible to pinpoint. Instead, it aims to <b>protect server requests</b> in order to make it harder for hackers to create compromised versions of your app that unlock premium features or inserts features like cheats. Note the word <b>harder</b>: as jailbreakers have physical access to their devices, nothing will <b>completely</b> safe-guard you from fraud in this case.</p>

<p>Debug menus in iOS are a very effective way to make your day more productive as a developer. If you find yourself doing the same debugging tasks over and over, such as printing backend responses, skipping to specific view controllers or copying user identifiers, it's nice to have special developer menus in your app that automatically handles these tasks for you. Let's see how we can use <code>UIContextMenuInteraction</code> to create debug-only special menus.</p>

<p>Widgets existed in iOS for a long time, but iOS 14 completely revamped them. With the new Widget APIs, not you're able to add widgets directly to your home screen, but they are also completely written in SwiftUI. iOS 14's Widgets come in a variety of shapes (literally), ranging from simple information squares to widgets that can retrieve and display information from its parent app's <b>Siri Intents</b>.</p>
<p>One trick that has drawn my attention the most however is that having widgets directly in your home means that technically you're now able to make visual "mini apps". If you find yourself doing the same tasks over and over in your job such as checking the number of crashes in a release or the latest release supported by one of your apps, you can create a Widget in iOS 14 that essentially behaves like a super-charged, UI-enabled <b>Siri Shortcut</b>.</p>

<p>I've always found throwing functions (<code>try/catch</code>, or <code>do/catch</code>) to be a very underrated feature in the Swift community. While many native APIs from iOS rely on it, very few people seem to actually use them in their daily projects. I've recently refactored one of my tools to completely rely on it, and the results exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p><code>ObjectIdentifier</code> is one of these obscure Swift types that you only see when looking at the answers for very specific problems in StackOverflow, and chances are that you have never really needed to use it. However, <code>ObjectIdentifier</code> plays an important part in Swift and is actually pretty useful as a solution to problems that involve metatypes.

<p><b>Global functions</b>, or functions that can be accessed from anywhere without the scope of a specific type is an old concept that was popular in languages like C and Objective-C, but unrecommended in Swift as we would rather have things that are nicely typed and scoped ("swifty").</p>
<p>For historical reasons, the Swift Standard Library still has quite a few public global functions, and some of them are still useful to this day. Let's take a look at functions like <code>zip()</code> and <code>dump()</code>.</p>

<p><b>Ordered Collection Diffing</b> is a feature added in Swift 5.1 that allows you to calculate and apply the difference between two collections. Using diffing libraries is common in iOS for a few reasons, the most popular one being to handle the addition and removal of elements in <code>UITableViews</code>. With the addition of this feature, developers can now diff <code>Collections</code> without having to bother with external libraries.</p>
<p>Have you wondered what efficiently diffing something looks like? In this article, we'll see and analyze the diffing APIs as well as the <b>Myers's Diffing Algorithm</b> used by the Swift Standard Library -- the same used in <b>git</b>.</p>

<p>While dividing an app into several modules can improve the build time of an iOS app, the result heavily depends on what is being changed. If you're not careful with how your dependency graph is laid out, you can often have results that are <b>worse</b> than non-modularized apps.

<p>Hashing algorithms are functions that map an arbitrary string to a seemingly "random" output with a fixed length. Commonly associated as a component of <code>Sets</code> and <code>Dictionaries</code>, hashing algorithms are a major component of several branches of computer science, including cryptography.</p>
<p>The internal algorithm used to calculate a type's <code>hashValue</code> (now <code>Hasher</code> in Swift 4.2) and the related compiler features changed several times throughout Swift's releases, and it was only after Swift 4.2 that a real universal hashing algorithm was added to Swift. To see how this is implemented today, let's take a look at how this looked like throughout the history of Swift.</p>

<p>With Swift being a very type-safe and namespaced language, you'll find that certain tasks are really hard to complete if at some point you can't determine the types that are being handled -- mostly when generics are involved. Using an automatic dependency injector as an example, let's see how generic arguments and closures can be "erased" to trick the compiler into compiling code that it would otherwise claim to be impossible. (when it's clearly not!)</p>
<p>While this isn't your usual SwiftRocks-compiler-feature-deconstruction article, we'll take an exciting look at how the treatment of methods/closures as properties can be used in this context to bypass one of the Swift Compiler's most annoying compilation errors.</p>

<p>Swift's <code>OptionSet</code> protocol is the bridged version of Objective-C's <code>NS_OPTIONS</code> enum -- a handy tool that allows you to very efficiently define a combination of "options" that can be used for a specific operation. Let's see what this protocol is, why <code>OptionSets</code> are preferred over a regular <code>Set</code> in some cases and finally what compiler magics it possesses.</p>

<p>Even in apps written in full Swift, interfacing with Objective-C is still a very big part of iOS development. Many types and semantics from Objective-C are hidden underneath the code we write today, and understanding where they come from can help you make better code decisions and just better understand the platform in general. This time, we'll take a look at what <code>NSCopying</code> and its companion class <code>NSZone</code> are and what they can do for Swift apps.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about Swift is that almost every compiler feature is built on top of actual classes and protocols of the language. This means that if you see a native type that has some special magical property (like SwiftUI's declarative syntax, which was covered in another post here in SwiftRocks), it's likely that you can reproduce that behavior in your custom types.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll cover one of my favorite syntax sugars in the language: the protocols and the internal compiler behavior that allow you to write <code>for</code> loops. You might have heard already of the <code>Sequence</code> family of protocols, and here, we'll see how the compiler uses them as the building blocks for <code>for</code> loops.</p>

<p>iOS 13 marks the release of long-waited features like Dark Mode, but it also brought some needed changes on less popular aspects. Prior to iOS 13, creating socket connections required coding very low-level network interactions which made libraries like Starscream and Socket.io the go-to solution for sockets in iOS. Now with iOS 13, a new native <code>URLSessionWebSocketTask</code> class is available to finally make creating and managing socket connections easier for developers.</p>

<p>Have you ever asked yourself which algorithm is used by Swift's sorting method? There are many sorting algorithms out there, and chances are that you'll rarely have to use something other than the language's builtin <code>sort()</code> method. However, knowing the properties of the sorting algorithm built into your language is important if you want to prevent unwanted behaviors and nasty edge cases.</p>

<p>While Xcode provides several visual abstractions for lldb commands like adding breakpoints by clicking the lines of code and running by clicking the play button, lldb provides several useful commands that are not present in Xcode's UI. This can range from creating methods on the fly to even changing the CPU's registers to force a specific flow on the app without having to recompile it, and knowing them can greatly improve your debugging experience.</p>

<p>The <code>Foundation</code> provides you a lot of the bread-and-butter needed for your daily iOS development, ranging from structures like <code>Data</code> all the way to complete APIs like <code>URLSession</code>. But as it turns out, we only use a fraction of what <code>Foundation</code> offers.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of Foundation types are <b>so situational</b> that people doubt they even existed in first place! In fact, they are so rarely mentioned as solutions to daily problems that developers may end up coding things that may <i>already</i> exist in these SDKs. But they do exist -- and although some of them are really old, most of these types are still very useful. Let's take a look at some of them!</p>

<p>Opaque Return Types is a feature added in Swift 5.1 that is a big part of the new SwiftUI framework's functionality. It comes to finally fix a fundamental problem of the usage of protocols and the design of Swift APIs, opening new possibilities for the creation and usage of public APIs.

<p>Announced in WWDC 2019, SwiftUI is an incredible UI building framework that might forever change how iOS apps are made. For years we've engaged in the war of writing views via Storyboard or View Code, and SwiftUI seems to finally end this. With its release, not only Storyboards are now pretty much irrelevant, but the old fashioned View Code is also very threatened as SwiftUI mixes the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The thing is, it looks very different from the Swift we're used to, and the reason is because it empowers a few new "unreleased" compiler features. Let's see how this works.</p>

<p>Foundation's <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> type, later abstracted to the <code>@autoreleasepool</code> block, is a very old concept in iOS development. During the Obj-C era of iOS, usage of this type was important to prevent your app's memory from blowing up in specific cases. As ARC and Swift came around and evolved, very few people still have to manually play around with memory, making seeing it become a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>Having developed tools that need to allocate enourmous amounts of memory, I asked myself if there's still a case where <code>@autoreleasepool</code> is useful in Swift 5. Here are the answers.</p>

<p>When teams start to grow, it becomes to difficult to track what everyone is doing. If the team has different ideas on what a specific piece of code should look like, you can very quickly end up with a project where nobody wanders outside the things they coded themselves. Style guides can be seen as an anti-pattern when the subject is speed and there is often resistence from developers that haven't been part of large projects, and indeed having a traditional bureaucratic process in this modern tech world seems very odd, but a strict style guide is critical to have a project scale to the point where you can have hundreds of developers like Uber.</p>

<p>When deadlines are tight and the product faces considerable changes, it's common for developers to make concessions in the project's quality to make sure it gets shipped in time. This leads to release anxiety - that stressful feeling where you're unsure if you're shipping something that actually works. As a result, teams resort to heavy amounts of manual testing, staying overtime to make sure nothing fell apart and an unhappy environment in general. <i>Avoiding Release Anxiety</i> is a series of posts where I show the things I do to develop durable Swift apps that allow me and my team to sleep worry-free at night.</p>

You can also use Siri Extensions, but then you have to deal with Siri, and the regular Siri Shortcuts relies on the Shortcuts app, so it's not something that you can provide to your users. Wouldn't it be great if you could give your users the ability to add shortcuts to things like ordering their favorite coffee in the shape of a home icon - just like the app itself?</p>
<p>Well, after reverse engineering Apple's Shortcuts app, it turns out that you can! That's exactly what it does when you add a system shortcut to the home screen, and we're going to <b>replicate it</b> in order to <b>give users the ability to add home icons that directly open a specific part of an app.</b></p>

          <p>Being able to work in projects of the most diverse varieties gave me the chance to be in contact with several types of developers and code bases. Besides their core differences, what stood out to me during this process is that projects with a lower level of maturity will always face similar problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps they choose the wrong architecture, or the lack of unit tests caused a nasty bug to sneak into production, but there's a specific problem that always draws my attention - callback hell. If not treated from the very beginning, these awful pyramids of braces you get when chaining callbacks inside other callbacks or conditions plague code bases with an eternity of impossible code-reviews and distant screams of "what the hell is this method supposed to be doing?". I've shared a few tips on how to avoid them.</p>

          <p>The <code>@dynamicMemberLookup</code> attribute was introduced in Swift 4.2 to add a certain degree of dynamism into the language similar to what is seen in languages like Python. I was interested in learning how the attributes worked inside the compiler to know more about how this attribute is able to transform fake expressions into legit ones, so I've <i>once again</i> reverse-engineered the Swift compiler to find these answers - and used this knowledge to create a brand new <code>@swiftRocks</code> attribute.</p>

          <p>Added in Swift 3, the <code>Never</code> type allows you to define a method that is guaranteed to crash your app. Although we rarely write methods that use this type directly, we do interact with it constantly given that it is the return type of all forced-crash methods like <code>fatalError()</code>. The advantage this type brings is that a method that calls another <code>Never</code>-returning method does not need to provide a return value, after all, a crash is certain to happen. I investigated how that works.</p>

          <p>Metatypes are pretty useful in Swift, and you have certainly used it in multiple occasions. Unfortunately they look pretty weird in code, which can cause some confusion when trying to understand what they really are.</p>
          <p>I for one know how these weird suffixes can confuse you, but don't worry, they are actually pretty straightforward once you get to know the differences between each of them.</p>

          <p>Siri Shortcuts are definitely my favorite iOS 12 feature. Ever since SiriKit first came out I was very disappointed that you couldn't use it for your own custom commands, but the new Shortcuts app solves this problem. Not only it allows you to create your custom commands, but it also provides a very intuitive UI to allow even non-devs to automate tons of kinds of workflows in their iPhones.</p>
          <p>We've all seen how to create a workflow and make your app expose custom actions, but one thing that I haven't seen people mention is that the Shortcuts app exposes several deeplinks for opening and running shortcuts - meaning that you can make an app that runs other apps' Siri Shortcuts. <a href="https://twitter.com/rockbruno_/status/1052625467147083777">I used this to make an app run my "Take Picture" shortcut every time I tapped my AirPods.</a></p>

          <p><code>CaseIterable</code> is one of my favorite features in Swift 4.2. Despite being a simple protocol, it solves the common problem (that I personally faced many times) of needing access to an array containing all the cases of a certain enum. But this protocol is special: The requirements are automatically filled by the compiler. I investigated how that works - and as a bonus, modified it to also provide a <code>first</code> property.</p>

          <p>Usage of high-order functions like <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> are very common in Swift projects, as they are simple algorithms that allow you to convert extensive ideas into simple one-liners. Unfortunately, they don't solve every issue - at least not in their default implementations. High-order functions are <i>eager</i>: they use the closure immediately and return a new array, regardless if you need an early return or only going to use specific elements.</p>

          <p>Pattern matching is available everywhere in Swift, and you have likely used it tons of times to deconstruct and bind values in things like <code>switch</code> cases. While regular <code>switch</code> cases are the most common use for patterns, Swift has several types of patterns which can be mixed and even used outside of <code>switches</code> to result in really cool and short lines of code. One thing that interests me in particular is that pattern matching can be used for a wide variety of things.</p>

          <p>The choice between using Storyboards and writing views programatically is very subjetive. Having dealt with both in the past, I personally vouch for writing projects entirely through view code as it allows multiple people to work in the same class without nasty conflicts, and easier code reviews.</p>
          <p>When starting with the practice of writing views programatically, a common problem people face is <i>where</i> to put the code in the first place. If you follow the regular storyboard approach of putting everything view related in your view controller, it's very easy to end up with gigantic classes. However, there's also a very easy way to overcome this problem.</p>

          <p>It's very common to use the <code>weak</code> keyword in order to prevent reference cycles in properties like delegates.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, since it protects you from references being lost, it forces the usage of <code>var</code> and an optional type, which can be quite jarring if you're building something like an <code>UIView</code> that is not supposed to be used without a delegate - much less change delegates suddenly. The <code>unowned</code> keyword allows you to overcome these issues.</p>

          <p>It's very likely that you asked yourself at least once in your iOS career what's the difference between a <code>struct</code> and a <code>class</code>. While realistically the choice between using one or another always boils down to <i>value semantics</i> versus <i>reference semantics</i>, the performance differences between the two are expressive and can heavily favor one or another depending on the contents of your object, specially when dealing with value types.</p> 
          <p>Some people might say that knowledge of memory architecture is irrelevant for application level developers, and I agree <i>partially</i>. Knowing how to save a few bits here and there will make no visible difference on newer iPhones, and premature optimization is a highly shunned practice.</p> 
          <p>However, both reference and value types can severely slow down your app when misused, and such knowledge will define whether or not you can fix the problem efficiently.</p>

          <p>I recently made a pull request to Swift, which inspired me to speak at Campinas's (Brazil) CocoaHeads about how can you do it yourself - and how to leverage the fact that Swift is open source to boost your career. I mixed <a href="https://academy.realm.io/posts/tryswift-jesse-squires-contributing-open-source-swift/">Jesse Squires's</a>, <a href="https://deadbeef.me/2017/08/contributing-to-swift">Mike Choi's</a> and <a href="https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/swift-stdlib-source/">Ole Begemann's</a> articles alongside my own discoveries to create a simple tutorial on how to approach the Swift Community. While the talk is in Brazilian Portuguese, hopefully the contents of the slides are simple enough to guide you through.<a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1vAxRVXBknyxl">You can watch it here.
